# day-planner

Simple TUI-app that helps you schedule your day. 

You write how long you want each activity to take, and it will automatically fill up your day by the ratio of the assigned times. You can also add fixed lengths and fixed start times. It is inspired by SuperMemo's Plan: https://youtu.be/aMj4GtU_A1Q
